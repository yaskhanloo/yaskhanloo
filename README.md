# 👋 Hi, I'm Yasaman

I'm a data scientist and NLP enthusiast exploring how language, structure, and systems come together in healthcare and beyond.

My work focuses on making complex data more accessible, reliable, and interpretable, using multiple different languages and tools.

### 🧠 Interests
- Clinical NLP & information extraction (German + multilingual)
- Interpretable AI in real-world domains
- MLOps and reproducible research tools
- Minimal UIs for annotation and insight

### 🛠 Personal Projects
- Clinical NER playgrounds (regex + transformer experiments)
- Lightweight annotation UIs (React, FastAPI)
- Data validation pipelines (ETL prototypes, testing frameworks)
- Soon: Visualization & exploratory tools for messy text

### 🌱 Learning & Building
- Currently leveling up in:
  - React & frontend tooling
  - Low-overhead MLOps workflows
  - Applied transformers for domain-specific tasks
